# DownloaderManager plugin for Phonegap (Cordova) #

The plugin can start and stop a file download from the web (HTTP).

## Adding the plugin to your project ##

1. To install the plugin, move DownloadManager.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html files. 
2. Create a folder called 'org/apache/cordova/plugins/DownloadManager' within your project's src/ folder.
3. And copy the .java files into that new folder.
4. Add the following to res/xml/plugins.xml file `<plugin name="DownloadManager" value="org.apache.cordova.plugins.DownloadManager.DownloadManager" />`.
5. If you want to use the Android Notification Bar to show the progress, and want icons there, the DownloadManager.java file needs to be edited. About Line 30, you have to import your own R. Of course, you need the icons too. You can use ones from the project (credits for: http://teusink.blogspot.com.es/2013/04/phonegap-android-downloader-plugin.html) and paste the icons on your projec's `res` folder. (You can generate icons here too --> http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/icons-notification.html but if you choose other filename for the icons, you need update the Downloader.java file too. About 136 line, change .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_stat_notification) with your own file name).

## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the method `downloadmanager(action, options, win, fail)`

`action` could be: 
1. `start` to beging to download a file
2. `cancel` to stop one
3. `isdownloading` to know the status of another

`options` is a json object containing the parameters (some optional) that DownloadManager accepts, it can be:

* `id:` an ID from a download process (required for "cancel" and "isdownloadind" action)
* `url:` the url to get (http://wherever.com/whatever.txt) (required for "start" action)
* `filePath:` path where to save the file (FileSystem/Download/YOUR_PATH) (optional, by default the app name)
* `fileName:` filename for the resource (FileSystem/Download/YOUR_PATH/YOUR_FILENAME.yy) (optional, by default the url name)
* `overwrite:` If the file already exists, download it again. (required for "start" action)
* `useNotificationBar:` `true`to use the Android notification bar to show the progress (optional, by defautl true)
* `startToast:` Message on toast at the beginning of the download process (optional)
* `endToast:` Message on toast at the end of the download process (optional)  
* `ticker:` Message to show on notification area where the download start (optional) 
* `notificationTitle:` Message to show on the notification bar while during download (optional)
* `cancelToast:`: Message on toast where the donwload is canceled (stoped) (optional)
 
`win` and `fail` are callback functions. Success will be called when there is a progress in the download. The passed object is:

    {
    	id: "45345"			// id to handle the process
    	downloading: true 	// true or false 
    	total: 1000,      	// The total number of bytes to download.
    	file: "file.ext"  	// Name of the file
    	dir: "youappname"	// Path where to download
        progress: 46,     	// In percent
    }

## Using the plugin ##
	
* Basic: (start a download on a notification bar)
    downloadmanager(
		"start",
		{
			url: url2down,
			overwrite: true
		},
		function(info) {
			console.info(info.progress);
			// Example to stop a download on 30%:
			downloadmanager("cancel", {id: info.id}, function() {}, function() {});
		},
		function(error) {
			console.error(error);
		}
	);

* Check if a donwload is in progress:
	downloadmanager("cancel", {id: "example_id"}, function(res) {
		alert(res); // true or false
	}, function() {});

* More:
	downloadmanager(
		"start",
		{
			url: "http://wherever.com/lalalala/.txt",
			filePath: "from_myapp",
			fileName: "hello.txt", // (FileSystem)/Download/from_myappp/hello.txt
			overwrite: false,
			useNotificationBar: true,
			startToast: "Starting download...",
			endToast: "Download end!",
			ticker: "Downloading...",
			notificationTitle: "hello.txt",
			cancelToast: "Download canceled!"
		},
		function(info) {
			console.info("id:          "+info.id+"\n" +
						 "downloading: "+info.downloading+"\n" +
						 "total:       "+info.total+"\n" +
						 "file:        "+info.file+"\n" +
						 "dir:         "+info.dir+"\n" +
						 "progress:    "+info.progress+"\n"
						);
			// progress bar example:
			$('#progress_bar').css('width', info.progress);
		},
		function(error) {
			alert(error);
		}
	);
